# Sonix-Flasher-Net
A scriptable flasher for Sonix based keyboards written in .Net

Right now it's still super early, but the goal is to offer both a GUI and a command line interface, with the ability to reboot keyboards to bootloader where possible, and flash them with firmware!

Any help is appreciated, especially if you know how to actually talk to the keyboard!
